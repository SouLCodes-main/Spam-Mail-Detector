# ðŸ“§ Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a **Spam Email Classifier** built using Python and machine learning. It takes in email content and predicts whether it's **spam** or **not spam (ham)**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Detects spam emails using natural language processing (NLP)
- Preprocessing of email text (removal of stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
- Trained with a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall
- Simple and clean code for easy understanding

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** (or your chosen classifier)
